# 🎓 Student Data Retrieval Agent using n8n

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates an **AI-like data retrieval agent** built with **n8n** that fetches and filters student information from a structured dataset using **SQL queries**. It automates student data search, reducing manual effort and enabling quick insights.

---

## 🔹 Features  
- ✅ Automated query handling (e.g., *“Show students with marks above 80”*).  
- ✅ Seamless **SQL database integration**.  
- ✅ Real-time student record retrieval.  
- ✅ Extensible workflow for larger datasets and complex queries.  
- ✅ Acts as a **data assistant** for academic use cases.

## 🔹 Tech Stack  
- **n8n** – Workflow automation  
- **SQL (MySQL/Postgres/SQLite)** – Database querying  
- **Database** – Student dataset storage  
- **Webhook/API** – (Optional) for external query execution  

---

## 🔹 Workflow Architecture  
1. **Trigger Node** – Accepts input query (manual/webhook/scheduled).  
2. **Function Node** – Preprocesses query if needed.  
3. **SQL Node** – Executes query on the student dataset.  
4. **Output Node** – Returns structured results (JSON/Table/CSV).

## 🔹 Impact  
- ⏱️ Saves time by automating student data retrieval.  
- 📊 Improves accessibility of academic datasets.  
- 🔗 Showcases integration of **SQL + n8n automation**.  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started  
1. Install and set up **n8n**.  
2. Connect your **SQL database** with the student dataset.  
3. Import the provided workflow into n8n.  
4. Run the workflow and query student data in real time.
